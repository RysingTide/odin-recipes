    <h1>Asian Barbequed Steak</h1>
    <h3>Description</h3>
    <p>
      Thai flavors combine to make one phenomenal steak! Flank steak is our
      favorite, but it's also great for other cuts of meat. It's great with
      grilled veggies, and perfect for salads and sandwiches.

    <p>"All I can say is "Wow!"."</p>
    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>1/4 cup chili sauce</li>
      <li>1/4 cup fish sauce</li>
      <li>1 1/2 tablespoons dark sesame oil</li>
      <li>1 tablespoon grated fresh ginger root</li>
      <li>3 cloves garlic, peeled and crushed</li>
      <li>2 pounds flank steak</li>
    </ul>
    <ol>
      <li>
        In a medium bowl, whisk together chili sauce, fish sauce, sesame oil,
        ginger, and garlic. Set aside a few tablespoons of the mixture for
        brushing the steaks during grilling. Score flank steak and place in a
        shallow dish. Pour remaining marinade over the steak, and turn to coat.
        Cover, and marinate in the refrigerator at least 3 hours.

        Lightly brush the grilling surface with oil. Grill steak 5 minutes per
        side, or to desired doneness, brushing frequently with the reserved
        marinade mixture.
